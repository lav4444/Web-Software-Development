# Web-Software-Development
In this repository I'm sharing codes that were part of Web Software Development subject at my collage (Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing).

Course content includes the fundamentals of web architectures, protocols, and standards, as well as programming in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. Students will learn the basic concepts and technologies of web software development and understand the features and functionality of the HTTP protocol and how it is used programmatically. Students will learn to design and implement a complete dynamic web application that includes a client and a server part and will be able to identify and evaluate the features of the developed solution.
